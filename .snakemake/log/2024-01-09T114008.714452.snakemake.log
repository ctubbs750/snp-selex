Workflow defines that rule genome_genome_install_genome is eligible for caching between workflows (use the --cache argument to enable this).
Lints for rule selex_echo_targets (line 92, /panfs/accrepfs.vampire/data/ruderferlab/projects/biovu/cnv/cre/CTCF-Variant-Annotation/snakemake/workflows/common/snp-selex/workflow/rules/selex.smk):
    * Migrate long run directives into scripts or notebooks:
      Long run directives hamper workflow readability. Use the script or notebook directive instead. Note that the script or notebook
      directive does not involve boilerplate. Similar to run, you will have direct access to params, input, output, and wildcards.Only use
      the run directive for a handful of lines.
