Building DAG of jobs...
Your conda installation is not configured to use strict channel priorities. This is however crucial for having robust and correct environments (for details, see https://conda-forge.org/docs/user/tipsandtricks.html). Please consider to configure strict priorities by executing 'conda config --set channel_priority strict'.

Job 5: 
        Columns will be: tf, snp, oligo_auc, oligo_pval, pbs, pval, batch
        Notes:
        - tail removes header
        - tr replaces :
        - vawk first split grabs TF from oligo ID
        - vawk gsub replace - in column 2
        - last vawk split formats oligo coords into vid to match novel batch format

        Notes:
